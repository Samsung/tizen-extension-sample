## Corresponding Android apps
The source codes for the corresponding Android sample apps can be found in [Samsung Developers > Build > Mobile > Galaxy Accessory > Downloads > Samples](https://developer.samsung.com/galaxy-accessory/download.html). The file contains two zip files; `Samples(Native).zip` and `Samples(Web).zip` which contains Tizen Native companion apps and Web companion apps, respectively. Both zip files contain the same Android companion sample code that also works with the .NET companion apps. You can build and install the Android companion app from either of files and test it with the .NET samples.
